# Instructions

## Functional Programming Principles
- Use functional programming principles.
- Use pure functions wherever possible.
- Use recursion instead of loops.
- Use immutable data structures.
- Use tail recursion when possible.
- Use higher-order functions.
- Use list comprehensions and generator expressions.
- Use map, filter, and reduce functions.
- Use lazy evaluation.
- Use pattern matching.
- Use type hints and type annotations.
- Avoid mutating props or reactive data directly.
- Prefer computed properties over methods for derived state.

## Vue 3 Specific Guidelines
- Always use Vue 3 Composition API over Options API.
- Use `<script setup>` syntax for cleaner component code.
- Leverage TypeScript for type safety and better DX.
- Use `defineProps()` and `defineEmits()` with TypeScript interfaces.
- Prefer `ref()` for primitive values and `reactive()` for objects.
- Use `computed()` for derived reactive state.
- Use `watch()` and `watchEffect()` for side effects.
- Implement proper lifecycle hooks (`onMounted`, `onUnmounted`, etc.).
- Use `nextTick()` when DOM updates are needed.
- Leverage `provide/inject` for dependency injection.
- Use `Teleport` for rendering content outside component tree.
- Use `Suspense` for async component loading.

## Pinia Store Guidelines
- Use Pinia stores for global state management.
- Define stores with the Composition API syntax using `defineStore()`.
- Keep store state minimal and normalized.
- Use getters (computed) for derived state.
- Make actions pure functions when possible.
- Use TypeScript interfaces for store state typing.
- Implement proper error handling in store actions.
- Use `storeToRefs()` to destructure reactive properties.
- Avoid direct store state mutation outside actions.
- Use store composition for complex state relationships.

## Vue Router Best Practices
- Use TypeScript for route definitions and navigation guards.
- Implement proper route guards for authentication and authorization.
- Use lazy loading for route components with `() => import()`.
- Define clear route meta properties for permissions and layout.
- Use programmatic navigation with proper error handling.
- Implement breadcrumbs and navigation state in stores.
- Use route params and query validation.
- Handle 404 and error routes appropriately.

## Testing with Vitest
- Write unit tests for all pure functions and utilities.
- Test Vue components using `@vue/test-utils`.
- Use `createTestingPinia()` for store testing.
- Mock external dependencies and API calls.
- Test user interactions and component events.
- Use `vi.mock()` for module mocking.
- Implement integration tests for critical user flows.
- Test error states and edge cases.
- Use descriptive test names and group related tests.
- Maintain high test coverage for business logic.

## Code Organization
- Use clear file and folder structure by feature/domain.
- Separate concerns: components, stores, utilities, types.
- Use barrel exports (`index.ts`) for clean imports.
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility.
- Extract reusable logic into composables.
- Use consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions).
- Implement proper error boundaries and error handling.

## TypeScript Guidelines
- Define strict interfaces for all data structures.
- Use generic types for reusable components and functions.
- Leverage union types and type guards for type safety.
- Use `as const` for immutable data structures.
- Implement proper type definitions for API responses.
- Use utility types (`Partial`, `Pick`, `Omit`) when appropriate.
- Avoid `any` type - use `unknown` or proper typing instead.

## Performance Considerations
- Use `shallowRef()` and `shallowReactive()` for large objects.
- Implement proper list rendering with unique keys.
- Use `v-memo` for expensive rendering operations.
- Lazy load components and routes.
- Debounce user input handling.
- Use `markRaw()` for non-reactive data.
- Implement proper cleanup in `onUnmounted()`.

# Domain Knowledge

## Vue 3 Ecosystem
- Vue 3 with TypeScript for type safety.
- Pinia store for state management.
- Vue Router for client-side routing.
- Vue Composition API for logic composition.
- Vitest for unit and integration testing.
- Vue Test Utils for component testing.
- Vite for build tooling and development server.

## Component Patterns
- Use composables for shared reactive logic.
- Implement render functions for dynamic components.
- Use slots for flexible component composition.
- Leverage scoped slots for data sharing.
- Create higher-order components when needed.
- Use dynamic components with proper typing.

## State Management Patterns
- Normalize complex nested data structures.
- Use actions for async operations and side effects.
- Implement optimistic updates where appropriate.
- Use store subscriptions for external sync.
- Handle loading and error states consistently.

## Testing Patterns
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert).
- Use factories for test data creation.
- Mock external services and APIs.
- Test component props, events, and slots.
- Use snapshot testing sparingly and meaningfully.

# Code Examples

## Component with TypeScript
```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
interface Props {
  title: string;
  items: Array<{ id: number; name: string }>;
}

interface Emits {
  select: [item: { id: number; name: string }];
  close: [];
}

const props = defineProps<Props>();
const emit = defineEmits<Emits>();

const selectedItem = ref<{ id: number; name: string } | null>(null);
</script>
```

## Pinia Store Pattern
```typescript
export const useGameStore = defineStore('game', () => {
  const state = reactive({
    players: [] as Player[],
    currentPlayer: 0,
    isGameActive: false
  });

  const currentPlayerData = computed(() => 
    state.players[state.currentPlayer]
  );

  const nextPlayer = () => {
    state.currentPlayer = (state.currentPlayer + 1) % state.players.length;
  };

  return {
    ...toRefs(state),
    currentPlayerData,
    nextPlayer
  };
});
```

## Testing Pattern
```typescript
describe('GameStore', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    setActivePinia(createPinia());
  });

  it('should advance to next player', () => {
    const store = useGameStore();
    store.players = [{ id: 1 }, { id: 2 }];
    store.currentPlayer = 0;
    
    store.nextPlayer();
    
    expect(store.currentPlayer).toBe(1);
  });
});
```
